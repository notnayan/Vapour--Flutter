# Vapour
A Flutter project, a subtle clone of Steam (hence the name Vapour, get it?), provides a games catalog with the name, price, rating, and developer. Users can view games, login/signup, and add/remove games from their cart or wishlist.
This project basically contains all the Flutter fundamentals alongside advanced techniques, state management, and CRUD functionalities in one application. 
Created using Flutter and Firebase.
